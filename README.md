# Game-Of-Life-Cuda
I took my existing version of game of life and added simple Cuda support.
This was coded and tested on a Macbook Pro. I have not tested it on Windows yet.
I will upload a VS project for windows when I get time.

## Controls
  ### Space Bar
    Pauses the simulation calculations. When paused it displays the last value of the framebuffer.
    *** More Controls will be added later
